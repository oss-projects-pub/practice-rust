6.  [ ] **Median & Mode Calculator:** Practice using Vectors and HashMaps for statistics.
7.  [ ] **Caesar Cipher:** Simple encryption/decryption of text files.
8.  [ ] **Unit Converter:** Weight, length, and volume conversions.
9.  [ ] **Password Generator:** Generate random secure passwords with custom criteria.

11. [ ] **Todo List CLI:** Persistent storage in a JSON or text file.
12. [ ] **Word Counter:** Frequency map of words in a large text document.
13. [ ] **Number Guessing Game:** High score tracking and persistent state.
14. [ ] **Simple Shell:** A program that executes system commands (like `ls`, `cd`).
15. [ ] **JSON Parser:** Use `serde` or build a simplified one from scratch.
16. [ ] **HTTP Client:** Fetch content from a URL using `reqwest` or raw TCP.
17. [ ] **Markdown to HTML Converter:** Simple regex-based or manual parser.
18. [ ] **Key-Value Store:** A local database that saves data to a binary format.
19. [ ] **In-Memory Cache:** A system with TTL (Time to Live) for cached entries.
20. [ ] **Expression Evaluator:** Parse and solve complex math strings like `(2 + 3) * 4`.

## 🔴 Level 3: Advanced Systems & Architecture
*Goal: Concurrency, Smart Pointers, Async/Await, and Data Structures.*

21. [ ] **Multi-threaded Web Crawler:** Parallel fetching with channel-based communication.
22. [ ] **Minigrep:** A search tool with pattern matching (Regex) support.
23. [ ] **TCP Chat Server:** Real-time communication between multiple clients.
24. [ ] **Redis Clone:** Implement basic GET/SET and TTL over TCP.
25. [ ] **Port Scanner:** Scan for open ports on a given IP or hostname efficiently.
26. [ ] **Custom Smart Pointer:** Implement your own version of `Box` or `Rc`.
27. [ ] **Linked List:** The "ultimate" Rust challenge (handling pointers safely).
28. [ ] **Job Queue:** A background worker system for processing tasks.
29. [ ] **File Compressor:** Implement a simple Huffman or LZW algorithm.
30. [ ] **Blockchain:** A simple chain with proof-of-work (hashing).

## 🚀 Level 4: The Mastery Challenges (Hardcore)
*Goal: High-performance systems, Emulators, and Web Frameworks.*

31. [ ] **CHIP-8 Emulator:** Emulate the classic 1970s microcomputer (great for binary logic).
32. [ ] **Web Server from Scratch:** No crates, just `std::net` and HTTP/1.1 parsing.
33. [ ] **WASM Image Filter:** Process images in the browser using Rust and WebAssembly.
34. [ ] **Database Engine (LSM Tree):** Build a persistent, high-performance storage engine.
35. [ ] **Static Site Generator:** Build something like Hugo or Jekyll in Rust.
36. [ ] **Rust-based OS Kernel:** Follow "Phil Opp's Blog OS" to boot a kernel.
37. [ ] **Video/Audio Transcoder:** Use FFmpeg bindings or raw byte manipulation.
38. [ ] **Neural Network from Scratch:** Implement backpropagation without external math libraries.
39. [ ] **Ray Tracer:** Generate realistic images by simulating light paths.
40. [ ] **Tauri System Monitor:** Build a desktop app (DockPilot style) to monitor CPU/GPU/Temp.

## 🧩 Domain Specific Challenges
*   [ ] **Networking:** Build a DNS resolver or a Load Balancer.
*   [ ] **Security:** Build a password manager with AES encryption.
*   [ ] **Game Dev:** Build a Snake or Tetris game using `ggez` or `bevy`.
*   [ ] **Tools:** Build a duplicate file finder or a folder sync utility.
