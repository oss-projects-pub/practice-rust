# Rust Practice Lab 🦀

Welcome to the Rust Practice Lab! This directory is dedicated to mastering Rust through hands-on exercises, daily challenges, and project-based learning.

## 🎯 Objective
To go from Rust beginner to advanced developer by building daily projects and exploring the deep concepts of the language (Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes, etc.).

## 🗺️ The Learning Plan
You can find the detailed 18-day mastery plan here:
👉 **[Mastery Plan](./PLAN.md)**

## 📂 Directory Structure
- `PLAN.md`: The roadmap for our learning journey.
- `day-X/`: Each day has its own directory with a project and a `README.md` containing specific instructions/concepts.
  - `day-1/`: Hello Rust & Cargo (Current)

## 🛠️ How to use this Lab
1. Check the `PLAN.md` to see what today's topic is.
2. Navigate to the corresponding day's folder (e.g., `cd practice/day-1`).
3. Read the `README.md` in that folder.
4. Implement the solution in `src/main.rs`.
5. Run it with `cargo run`.
